# Overview #

Admin is a CMS web-front-end frame(back-end will be added later, using ASP.NET probably, based on enough time), build by Bootstrap v3.1.1

# Usage #

I suggest the following two ways here:

1. Copy front-end folder to IIS server, then set dashboard.html as launch page, then run it
2. Download [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), and put front-end folder into &lt;your disk&gt;:/xampp/htdocs, then run localhost on your browsers
